    <h1>Peanut Butter Spider Cookies</h1>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>½ cup peanut butter</li>
        <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar for rolling</li>
        <li>24 chocolate truffles (such as Lindt Lindor®), chilled</li>
        <li>48 decorative candy eyeballs</li>
        <li>½ cup prepared chocolate frosting</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Beat shortening, peanut butter, brown sugar, and ½ cup white sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Beat egg into the creamy mixture until fully incorporated. Stir milk and vanilla extract into the mixture until smooth.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl; add to peanut butter mixture in the large bowl and stir until completely incorporated into a dough.</li>
        <li>Divide and shape dough into 48 balls.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/4 cup white sugar into a wide, shallow bowl. Roll dough balls in sugar to coat and arrange about 2 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove cookies from oven and quickly press a dimple into the center of each cookie using the blunt end of a wooden spoon. Cool cookies on sheets for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Cut each chocolate truffle in half. Put one piece atop each cookie with the rounded side facing upwards.</li>
        <li>Spoon frosting into a piping bag fitted with a small round tip, or use a resealable plastic bag with a corner snipped off. Dab a small amount of frosting onto the back of each candy eyeball and stick two onto each chocolate candy to resemble eyes. Then pipe frosting in four thin lines, starting at the base of the candy, on each side atop the cookie to resemble spider legs.</li>
        <li>Let frosting harden at room temperature, about 30 minutes. Store cookies in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Additional Tips</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Citrus reamers work great for making dimples in the cookies.</li>
        <li>Keep the chocolate candy chilled to slice in half easier. Too warm of a center may result in bends or cracks.</li>
        <li>Use mini peanut butter cups if you prefer.</li>
        <li>Add red gel frosting around the eyes to make a spooky spider.</li>
    </ul>
